                <h5>GENDER EQUALITY SHOULD BE EMBRACED</h5>
                <p>People of all gender must have equal rights, responsibilities and oppurtunities. Women and girls are not given the same oppurtunities as boys and girls. In many countries women are seen as less important as men. Even now, the birth of a girl is still not acceptable in some parts of the country. Some people still believe girls and women are meant to stay in their houses and look after the kitchen.They do not like women to do other tasks except for household ones, which is not meant to be. Both gender should and must be equal. </p>

    <h1>GENDER EQUALITY</h1>
    <h5>Gender equality is a situation in which access to right or opportunities is unaffected  by gender.</h5>
    <h3>Importance Of Gender Equality</h3>
    <ol>
        <h6>
    <li>IT RESULTS IN BETTER HEALTHCARE : Generally, research shows that women receive worse medical care than men. Gender inequality in the medical research community also leads to worse care. Diseases that affects women more than men are not well researched,they are often not taken seriously by medical professionals. When women are equal in the society their health will be impacted positively.</li><br>
    <li>CHILDREN GET HEALTHIER : When women make their own reproductive choices they provide better care for the children they have. Children raised in gender equal environments will do better than those raised with inequality. With equal  income with men, mothers can offer healthcare and healthier food to their children.   </li><br>
    <li>IT REDUCES HUMAN TRAFFICKING : Women and girls are the main victims of human trafficking, they are more vulnerable and traffickers see them as easier target. With better education and job opportunities,women and girls don't end up being trafficked as usual. </li><br>
    <li>IT REDUCES POVERTY : Poverty is mainly found in young girls. As boys and girls get older the rate of poverty gets larger. This is because girls don't receive the same job opportunities and education. Gender equality keeps women and their families trapped in poverty. when women recieve good education,health care and job opportunities they can thrive. </li><br>
    <li>IT HELPS BUSINESS : When women recieve the same education and job opportunities as men, they can improve any organization they join. Study shows that diversity of all types increases an organization productivity and innovation.
